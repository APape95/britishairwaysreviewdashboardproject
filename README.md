# ‚úàÔ∏è British Airways Reviews Dashboard

## üöÄ Project Overview

This dataset includes valuable feedback categorized by **aircraft type**, **cabin type**, **traveller type**, and **traveller country**. BA is seeking to gain insights into customer experiences, identify trends in satisfaction across different categories, and pinpoint areas for improvement.

This project focuses on creating an **interactive Tableau dashboard** that organizes and visualizes this data, making it easy to compare reviews and uncover actionable insights. By analyzing the feedback, BA can enhance customer satisfaction and make data-driven improvements to their services.

### üéØ Project Goals

  - **Aircraft Type**
  - **Cabin Type** (e.g., Economy, Business, First)
  - **Traveler Type** (e.g., Family, Solo, Business Traveler)
  - **Traveler Country**
- Provide a **centralized view** of customer feedback to help BA leadership understand overall and segmented performance.
- Build an **interactive dashboard** with dynamic filters to allow BA teams to explore data by specific criteria.

## ‚ú® Key Insights & Recommendations
Based on the analysis of BA's review dataset, the following insights and recommendations were identified:

1. **Focus on Underperforming Cabin Types**:  
   - Economy class reviews show lower satisfaction compared to Business and First Class. Consider improving seat comfort, meal quality, and entertainment options for economy travelers.
   
2. **Enhance Services for Family Travelers**:  
   - Family travelers report lower satisfaction. Offering better child-friendly amenities and services could improve their experience.

3. **Highlight Positive Performance in Certain Aircraft Types**:  
   - Newer aircraft types like the Airbus A350 receive consistently higher ratings. Showcase these aircraft in marketing efforts to attract customers.

4. **Improve Satisfaction for Specific Regions**:  
   - Feedback from travelers in certain regions (e.g., South America) suggests a need for better customer service. Training cabin crew to address regional preferences and expectations can help boost satisfaction.

5. **Leverage Traveler Country Insights**:  
   - Reviews from countries with high satisfaction can guide targeted marketing efforts, while countries with lower satisfaction can benefit from localized improvements in service.

### Example Use Case
BA's leadership can use this dashboard to:
- Identify and address pain points in specific cabin types or aircraft.
- Tailor services to meet the needs of different traveler types.
- Track geographic satisfaction trends to inform global marketing and service strategies.
- Monitor satisfaction trends over time to measure the impact of implemented changes.
